									<h1>The Trolley Problem</h1>
									<p>The infamous trolley problem is a ethical problem which has divided people for decades. Here I propose and justify what I believe is the ethical choice of action.</p>

                                <b>Scenario 1: Trolley Problem</b>

								<p>There is a runaway train hurtling down the tracks. If it continues on its current path, it will mow down 5 innocent victims who have been strapped to the tracks. However, there is a lever in front of you. If you pull the lever, the train will be diverted onto a second set of tracks. But wait – on this set of tracks, one person is tied down. You have 2 options: 
                                    <ol> 
                                    <li><i>Do nothing, which would lead to 5 people getting hit by the train and dying</i></li>
                                    OR 
                                    <li><i>Divert the train, killing 1 person</i></li>
                                    </ol>
                                    What would you do?
                                    </p>

                                <p>Most people choose the second option. After all, it’s simple maths isn’t it? 1 death is better than 5, so we should divert the train.</p>

                                <b>Scenario 2: Surgical Problem</b>

                                <p>Ok, now consider a different scenario. You are an experienced surgeon. One of your patients has come in requiring relatively simple surgery. You also have 5 other patients who are in dire need of different organ transplants in order to survive. Now, you must make a decision: do you perform the simple surgery on the first patient, and let the other 5 die? Or do you harvest the first patient’s organs, which kills them, but then put these organs into the 5 patients requiring organ donations? In this scenario, assume that surgeries carry no real risk and the organs are a perfect match between patients.</p>

                                <p>Most people would not harvest organs from the unsuspecting patient. But why is this? Judging by the logic we used in the trolley problem before, surely saving 5 lives at the expense of one is the morally good thing to do?</p>

                                <p>The juxtaposition of these 2 situations highlights that people have a gut sense of right and wrong, but  this moral judgement can be inconsistent. People feel a lot more personally involved with the idea of harvesting someone’s organs, but pulling a lever seems a   lot less personal and less emotional. But this is a distinction without a difference. In both cases, you are choosing between letting 5 people die or killing 1 person to save 5.</p>
                                
                                <p>Given this inconsistency, how do we know what is the morally correct thing to do in this case? To remove emotional bias as much as possible, we need an explicit moral framework.</p>
                                    
                                <h3>Choosing a moral framework</h3>

                                <b>Religious Frameworks</b> 

                                <p>Most people around the world get a moral framework from their religious beliefs. They believe in some kind of divine revelation which informs them on how they should behave and provides them with a sense of good and bad. Crucial to religious belief is “faith”. Having faith allows people to believe things which logic and reason do not necessarily support. Religious believers can passionately live by principles of good and bad purely because they have faith that it is the right thing to do, as desired by some divine power.</p>

                                <b>Scientific Frameworks</b>

                                <p>I do not have faith in any one particular religion as being a source of pure moral truths – i.e. I do not believe that any religion has perfectly laid out what it means to be good or bad. Given this, I cannot rely on a religion to derive fundamental moral values.</p>

                                <p>So where else can I (and people like me) go to find out what is good and bad? Some atheists are critical of religion and believe that science can replace religion. However, science can only go so far. Science is an effective tool at helping us achieve things. However, it cannot tell us what to achieve. For example, I currently have a sore throat. Based on the scientific literature, I believe that taking paracetamol will reduce the pain I feel in my throat without taking on any real risk to my health. However, science cannot tell me that reducing pain is good. Whether or not I want to reduce pain is a question outside the realm of science. Once I have decided I want to reduce the pain, then I can leverage medicine to achieve the desired outcome.</p>

                                <b>Proposing a Moral Framework</b>

                                <p>Alright, so I cannot use conventional religion or science to derive moral values. Where can I look? I do not  know a robust answer to this. The best I have come across is that in a few cases, the vast majority of us agree on what good and bad are:
                                    <ul>
                                    <li>Unnecessary pain and suffering is bad.</li>
                                    <li>Happiness and fulfilment is good.</li>
                                    <li>Providing value to others is good.</li>
                                    <li>Being free is good.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>

                                <p>There are still problems with the list – some people may disagree, and the devil is in the detail of the vague points, but I think this provides a relatively stable starting point that most people would agree on. Naturally would want to end up in a place where good is maximised and bad is minimised.</p>

                                <h3>Rules of morality based on the moral framework</h3>

                                <p>In order to get to that long-term outcome, we must act in a certain way now to get there. We must have a set of rules we can follow to maximize the chances of reaching this long-term goal. Now that we have an idea of where good and bad come from, I propose a rule we follow now to try to reach the end goal: “Thou shalt not murder”. If we do not follow this rule and instead permit murder, we lose order and trust in society. If we apply this rule to the trolley problem, we should not pull the lever. We should let the train kill 5 people. In this case, we would not be murdering anyone. However, if we pull the lever, we are murdering someone.</p>

                                <p>What would happen if we relaxed our rule, and allow murdering in the case where we save more people than we kill? In this case, we would be able to kill 1 individual and save 5 people. However, I think the consequences of this adjusted rule would be bad long-term. It would allow doctors to harvest organs from innocent people and use them to save lives of others. It chips away at people’s fundamental right to life. These powers could also be exploited for political purposes. Vulnerable people or political dissidents could be killed with the superficial justification of   preserving the lives of those who require organs transplants.</p>

                                <h3>Summary</h3>

                                <p>Overall, I believe the rule “thou shalt not murder” is a good rule, and therefore think in the case of the trolley problem, the train should be left to kill the 5 individuals. Alternative rules could open a Pandora’s Box of unintended consequences. You may have recognized the rule I proposed from the 10 commandments. Following this commandment through faith alone would have allowed me to reach the same conclusion regarding the trolley problem a lot quicker. Of course, I am not a believer in any Abrahamic religion, so this is not something I can justify. But perhaps there is more wisdom and utility in religion than some fellow atheists give credit for...</p>
