									<h1>Happiness and Income</h1>
									<p>GDP has been used since WW2 to be arguably the single most important indicator of a country's success - but how strong is the relationship between income and happiness?</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/happines_v_income1.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>In 2017 I studied my first ever statistics module at secondary school. When I learned about linear regression, I was under the impression I already had enough skills to assess any relationship between to variables. Boy was I wrong. Confounding variables and many other potential causes of endogeneity were not accounted for.</p>

                                <p>However, my interest in applying linear regression to something I was interested in, namely the impact of GDP on happiness, was still helpful.</p>
									
                                <p>I used data from the UN and IMF to conduct the most basic of econometrics analyses. With hindsight, the report below and its findings were not rigorous. But it was appealing to me that I could play with the numbers myself and reach the same conclusion as Professor Richard Layard, who had spent his life examining the same issue, albeit in a much more robust way.</p>
