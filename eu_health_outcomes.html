									<h1>EU Health Outcomes</h1>
									
								</header>
								<p>Macroeconomic data is notoriously difficult to draw conclusions from. This is why amongst economists debate continues to froth about the impact of government intervention, or democracy on economic growth. Similarly, there has been a debates for decades, if not centuries, about the optimal diet in the healthcare and nutrition community.</p>

                                <p>I decided to combine both of these confusing areas to see if any insights can be gleaned. I investigated how health outcomes across the EU changed over the past few decades.</p>

                                <p>On my GitHub you can access my data and report.</p>

                                <p>Many researchers have tried to do the same. Early work from the beginning of the 21st century was methodologically flawed. Due to a lack of data, omitted variables led to strange conclusions being drawn. Univariate analyses have easily demonstrable flaws. If you look at the correlation between alcohol consumption and health outcomes across the world for example, you may mistakenly conclude that alcohol is in fact a miracle drug, as alcohol consumption is higher in countries like Japan, and so is life expectancy.</p>

                                <p>Later work then had slightly more complicated issues. For example, a basic OLS linear regression across the whole of the EU could lead to the wrong conclusions being drawn unless the impact of specific effects are accounted for. To solve this issue random effects, fixed effects and first differences analyses are used. From my analysis, fixed effects analysis is the most appropriate for the task.</p>

                                <p>So what did I find?</p>

                                <p>Some obvious effects were borne out in the data. Alcohol is associated with worse health outcomes, but this effect is mitigated by increased health spending. When obesity rates are high, any increase in it is associated with a deterioration of health.</p>

                                <p>Some other statistically significant findings require more explanation. When obesity rates are low, an increase in obesity leads to health outcome improvements. This could be as obesity rates rise, malnourished people could also have access to more food, and these people would become healthier. This effect could dominate when the obesity rate increases from an initially low level.</p>

                                <p>Another odd finding was that that long-term unemployment is associated with better health. This could be because high long-term unemployment could be partly caused by large welfare states and relatively high benefits. Unemployed workers can remain unemployed for longer due to higher benefits, and will still have access to cheap/free healthcare without having to get a job to pay for it.</p>

                                <p>Finally, the impact of the time trend on improving health outcomes was dominating the trend. This means that there were factors improving the EUâ€™s health outcomes over time that were not included in my (large) model. Often, the literature in this area assumes that these exogenous change must be changes in technology. If so, this highlights where the future improvements in health outcomes will come from.</p>

                                <p>Technology is the future.</p>
